# ML-Churn Prediction of a telecom Company

The goal of this project was to utilize classification models to predict whether or not a customer would churn. I went through the entire machine learning pipeline, discovered drivers of churn, and created many different models. Ultimately, my best Random Forest Classifier model was able to predict churned customers with an accuracy of about 80%.
